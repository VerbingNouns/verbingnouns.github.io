[≫GET IN CONTACT WITH ME≪](mail-to:lauren.ackerman@ncl.ac.uk)

I am a Research Associate in Linguistics at Newcastle University in the School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics. I am also affiliated with Newcastle’s Centre for Behaviour and Evolution and I lead the Language & Cognition research group on campus. Off-campus, I was a founding member and organiser of [R Ladies Newcastle](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newcastle/), which I put on hiatus at the start of the pandemic.
